    <ul>
      <li>Born 10 July 1856, in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia)
</li>
      <li>Studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree</li>
      <li>In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen.</li>
      <li>His AC induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.</li>
      <li>In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.</li>
      <li>Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills.</li>
      <li>He died in New York City in January 1943.</li>
